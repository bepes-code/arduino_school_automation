# School automation project with arduino
## Introduction
This project starts at may of 2022, when in spain the 2n year students of "bachillerat" (the last grade before the university) had to made a TDR project (Research project), my tutor proposed me the idea of automating the classrooms of the institute to seek better efficiency. Me and other 2 classmates accept that rept, and we start working at this. And thats its, finally we can finished the project.
## About the project
The project consist in 2 parts, the web, in which you can control de classes, and the arduino, the microproccesor who control and obey the orders and petitions of the web. This project are based in the classes, and we utilize 3 arduinos, one of this, control de access in the class, with a fingerprint detector and an intelligent knob, the secondone, conect the light of the class into the arduino and send the information with bluetooh to de main arudino, who has de sensors of temperature, humidity, and precence, that lastone also have a IR sensor who can open on close the devices of the class. With a Wifi moudule send the information in a SQL database and then, in the web we can read and modify that information.
## How to deploy the project
Soon, youtube video about how to deploy the project. 
Link [here](www.youtube.com)
### Web
1. Firstly, you need a domain and a hosting with the possibilite to update 2 databases. You can find one free [here](https://es.000webhost.com/)
2. Update the databases and the files
3. Upload the dataabse credentials acces in the file ...
4. Upload the web files in the hosting
### Arduino   
5. Mount the arduinos with the schemas (Next point)
6. Update the wifi credentials, and the web information
7. Upload the files in to the arduino
[That video maibe helps you to deploy the project]()
## Arduino Schemas
[Main Case]()
[Door Case]()
[Rele Case]()

## Thanks
Thanks to 
@RTrebla to the developemnt of the arduinos
@Uriii14 to bla bla bla
Thanks to electronoonbs, for the idea of the code who send the arduino information to the dabase
